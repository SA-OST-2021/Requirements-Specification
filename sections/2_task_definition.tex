\section{Task Definition}
To collect vehicle data of the Fleet Management System (FMS) and provide IP-based access, a dedicated device has to be developed. It acts as a gateway (communication bridge) and connects the internal CAN-Bus to the on-board network router via LAN or WLAN.


A general block diagram of the system is shown in \cref{fig:constellation_HW}.

FMS-Packets are received and processed by the gateway. A configurable filter decides which packets get forwarded and limits the maximal transmission update rate. The network router acts as a receiver, which can upload the information  over the internet to a cloud-based system.
Device settings as well as the filter configuration

To gather additional motion data of the vehicle, an inertial measurement unit (IMU) should be integrated.
